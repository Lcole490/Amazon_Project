# Amazon_Project


The goal of this Project is to formulate a real-life full stack application. For this exercise, Amazon's website was the model to be used. 


Initial Goals of Project:

1. Be A full-stack application 
2. Clone the Amazon site in look and organization



How should the Project be implemented?

In embarking on this project, a main question to be answered is "What technologies will be used to complete this task?"

I decided to utilize React and Firebase to complete the project. I chose to use React because it's component capabilities would 
allow for organization and implementation of various entities of the app that can be updatable or interchangeable without presenting
major interruptions to the main app. 

I decided to go with Firebase in order to diversify my choice for database and backend solutions. I have usually used MongoDB and MySQL in the past
and want to gain more experience using Firebase's database and authentication capabilities.




Other implementations:

- Styled Components
- Material UI Icons
- Firebase Authentication & Hosting
